# Scope of Work (SOW) â€“ Virtual SMT Line Simulator

## Project Title
Virtual SMT Line Simulator

## Purpose
Develop a modular, GUI-based software tool to simulate the process flow of a surface-mount technology (SMT) production line.

## Objective
- Validate barcode-to-profile matching logic
- Train users on SMT process flow virtually
- Simulate basic error conditions (wrong profile, failed SPI, etc.)

## Deliverables
- GUI for operating each SMT station module
- Simulated barcode and board profile table
- Board traceability and logging
- Configurable board input
