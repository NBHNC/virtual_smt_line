### ✅ v1.0 – May 31, 2025

**Status:** Full SMT Line Simulation Functional

**Implemented:**
- All 7 SMT stations simulated:
  - Unloader
  - Paste Printer
  - SPI Inspection
  - Pick & Place
  - Reflow Oven
  - AOI Inspection
  - Stacker
- Modular structure using separate Python files
- GUI built using PySimpleGUI with manual board advancement
- Reflow oven profile matching logic
- SPI and AOI simulated with pass/fail outcomes
- Board traceability logging to CSV
- Git version control in place

**Scope Alignment:**
- ✅ Matches all SOW deliverables
- ✅ Stays within defined Out-of-Scope (no hardware control)
- ✅ Ready for enhancements (alarms, automation, batch processing)

**Next Possible Enhancements:**
- Alarm handling for failed inspections or oven mismatch
- Batch processing of multiple boards
- Summary dashboards or status panels
- GitHub push or cloud-hosted repo
